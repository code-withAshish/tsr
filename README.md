A simple and idiotic replacement (not really) to `ts-node` that i wrote for my personal use using `esbuild` golang API, it does only one things transpiles `ts -> js` and executes the code in `node`.

## Installation

For now it's DIY (also i am lazy) clone this repo build the binary and just use it maybe i'll complete this part later.

## Usage

```bash
tsr /path/to/file.ts
```
